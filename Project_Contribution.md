# Project Collaboration

This Project_Contribution.md documents the collaborative efforts of the team in developing a sleep inducer program. 

## Team Collaboration

- Collaborated as a team to create the base code structure.
- Worked together to design and implement various functions such as insert, search, delete, set dorm, and sleep inducer.
- Shared equal responsibilities in coding, testing, and debugging the program.
- Actively participated in discussions, exchanged ideas, and provided feedback to enhance the overall efficiency and functionality of the code.
- Each member contributed their expertise and time to different aspects of the project.

## Individual Contributions

- **Daksh**: Created the initial README.md file, providing an outline and initial information about the project. Focused on adding comments throughout the code for better understanding and contributed to the search function without using a hashmap.
- **Om**: Later updated the README.md file with additional details and relevant information about the codebase. Provided the pseudo code, offered insights into algorithmic approaches, and contributed to the delete inmate function and ifexist inmate function.
- **Diyen**: Suggested the implementation of a hashmap in the search function to improve efficiency and also contributed to the sleep inducer function. Worked on formatting the code, adding color schemes for visualization, and provided explanations for better comprehension.
- **Parva**: Contributed to the insert function, set dorm function, provided analysis on the time and space complexities of the code, and assisted in explaining the code.
  
## Conclusion

All members ensured that the workload was evenly distributed among the team members. Overall, the collaborative effort of the team resulted in the efficient development of the program, with each member contributing their skills and time to achieve the common goal.
